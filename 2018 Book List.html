                                    ocean's diminishes. This book touches on a number of important issues like the
                                    rise in jellyfish blooms; the ubiquitousness and dangers of too much blue algea
                                    as it turns our oceans to slime; dead patches in our oceans where life cannot
                                    exist; the introduction of carbon dioxide to our oceans which is causing
                                    acidification and melting coral reefs; the toxicity of fish like tuna which are
                                    high on the food chain and the effects that consuming these fish have on our
                                    health; and more.</p>

                                <p>In the book, "Waking Up" Sam Harris tries to persuade his readers to
                                    reject dogmatic religiosity in favor for modern spirituality which utilizes
                                    scientifically proven techniques like mindfulness and meditation ranther than blind
                                    faith. This book was a challenging read, but intellectually stimulating and
                                    convincing in its central argument that science is not able to explain everything
                                    and so a kind of "religion" is warranted, but the precepts of many religions and
                                    cults, particularly the Abrahamic religions of Christianity, Judism, and Islam
                                    require us to follow strict dogmatic beliefs before any spirituality can be attained
                                    and thus are problematic. This book was a nice change in genre, as this year has
                                    been predominantly fiction.</p>

                                    <p>In this light in weight, but heavy in thought book, Sam Harris makes
                                        the arguments that the notion of free will is an illusion. The fact that our
                                        brain
                                        fires neurons to react even before we consciously make a decision suggests that
                                        we
                                        lack free will. On top of this, the fact that thoughts, urges, feelings, and
                                        impulses do not originate in the consciousness, but rather appear in our
                                        consicousness begs us to question again whether free will exists. While I can't
                                        possibly pretend to understand all the deeper im;lications this book has to
                                        offer,
                                        nonetheless this book is a fascinating and thoughful read.</p>

                                <p>A historical fiction novel about the "Bone Wars" between then prominent
                                    paleontologists Cope and Marsh and the expedition that occured in the Summer of
                                    1878. This story is told from the perspective of fictional character Johnsom as he
                                    joins the expedition upon a bet from his university rival. The historical
                                    perspective of Indian Wars then occuring in the west and the details of life in the
                                    wild west were very interesting and have throughly piqued my interest in reading
                                    further historical fiction. Highly recommended!</p>

                                    the brutal and unnerving killing of her friend Khalil when the two are pulled over
                                    and harassed by police. This book is timely as the "Black Lives Matter" movement is
                                    still being discussed throughout the nation. But even more interesting than the
                                    impactful storyline is the unique perspective of the author and voices whe gives to

                                        hisdicovery and coming to terms with his sexuality and feelings for his best
                                        friend Dante. The inner turmoil and loneliness Aristotle struggled with struck a
                                        real chord with me as I reflect on my own experiences growing up, particularly
                                        his quietness as a means to protect himself from revealing too much is a problem
                                        I struggle with to this day. The drama that unfolds in this book are touching
                                        and the dialogue especially between Aristotle and his mother brought me to tears
                                        on many occasions. Highly recommended to any gay teens or anyone interested in a
                                        well-written coming-of-age story.</p>

                                <p>A beautifully illustrated crime mystery surrounded by murders at Gaudi's revered
                                    architectural sites around Barcelona. The story is intriguing, well paced and
                                    thrilling. The character design and art direction are well realized and the
                                    attention to detail is staggering. The colors pop and the architectural
                                    illustrations make me want to visit these sites first hand. This book is brilliant
                                    in every way. I cannot recommend it enough!</p>

                                <p>A graphic novel about thriteen-year-old Marjorie who is in charge of her family's
                                    failing laundry business and Wendell the young ghost who befriends and ultimately
                                    helps save Marjorie's dwindling business. The story is perhaps too simplistic, but
                                    the artwork is beautifully drawn and the colors are reminiscent of an autumnal
                                    sunset. A quick, but fun read and perfect for Halloween.</p>

                                    <p>This is a Marvel superhero story set in an alternate universe in which there are
                                        multiple Spidermen and Spiderwomen fighting alongside the Avengers. The story is
                                        fresh and seems relevant to our current society by managing to comment on issues
                                        like race, body image and gender equality. The style is bold and beautifully
                                        illustrated. I can't wait to read volume two!</p>
